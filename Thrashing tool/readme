memoryScanKernel.c does not work do not worry about it for functionality.

It was found that several of the API's i would need for the last step
will not function except on specific versions of linux that proved very
hard for me to figure out how to get everything setup for.

testExec.c is just a test program. You can run a.out and type testExec 
when prompted to by a.out to launch it with thrashing protections.
