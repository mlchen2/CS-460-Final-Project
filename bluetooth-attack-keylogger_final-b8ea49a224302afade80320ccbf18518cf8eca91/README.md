Keylogger

To run: run "keylogger.py" on the victim machine and "serverlogger.py <victim's IP>" on some other computer (could also be on the same machine as victim, w/e).

The serverlogger program will give command prompts upon sycning with the victim machine that's running the keylogger.

*Note* This works on Windows, not sure about OS X or Linux. Might have to change 1 line in keylogger.py if it throws an error. But idk.
