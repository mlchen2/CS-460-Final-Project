First crack ltk-exchange.pcap to extract the LTK:

    $ crackle -i ltk_exchange.pcap -o foo.pcap


    !!!
    TK found: 000000
    ding ding ding, using a TK of 0! Just Cracks(tm)

    Warning: packet is too short to be encrypted (1), skipping
    LTK found: 7f62c053f104a5bbe68b1d896a2ed49c
    Done, processed 712 total packets, decrypted 3

Then use that LTK to decrypt the second PCAP file:

    $ crackle -l 7f62c053f104a5bbe68b1d896a2ed49c -i encrypted_known_ltk.pcap -o decrypted.pcap
